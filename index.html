<h1>GPU computing for statisticians</h1>

Welcome to the Iowa State University Statistics Department's
2013 seminar series on GPU computing for statisticians. Click the "Talks" tab
for the schedule of talks and links to the materials for each talk. 
Posted materials include lecture slides and example code for all talks, plus 
screencasts of talks that have already been given.<br/><br/>

The purpose of these talks is to teach viewers how to create fast statistical
software using GPU parallelism. Participants will understand basic principles 
of parallel computing and learn tools in R, CUDA
C/C++, and Python to help them write GPU-accelerated computer code. 
<br/><br/>

GPUs, or Graphics processing units, were mostly used as gaming toys at their inception. But now, 
scientists and statisticians use GPUs to speed up their data analysis
software by orders of magnitude. Become a part of this revolution in 
massively parallel computing and come learn how to speed up a variety of 
parallelizable computations, from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
to K-means clustering and beyond.
